### Before submitting

- Make sure you have built the correct theme versions for gtk3, gnome-shell and cinnamon themes.
- Test whether the issue also appears with default themes (e.g. Adwaita for gtk and gnome). If it does, this often means that the problem should be reported for the application/desktop/tookit in question. Feel free to report the issue here regardless if you're unsure.

### Details

Unless this is a non-visual issue, always add screenshots to help describe your problem.

Please add the following information:

- Distribution and version
- Versions for the affected applications/desktops/tookits
